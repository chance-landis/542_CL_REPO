Find 3 different information structures with different access technologies
(e.g. API, DB connection, file download and read locally). Write python
functions to access each one and print out a sample of the information. In 
comments for each function, describe pros and cons of the access 
methodology. Upload code to Github and share URL, make sure any instructions
needed to run are available in comments, preferably downloading and running
